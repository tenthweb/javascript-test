# The Wolf, Goat, Cabbage Problem
The Wolf, Goat, Cabbage Problem is an old riddle that has elements of logic to it. The purpose of this application is to make a playable version of the riddle available. It is intended for people interested in seeing how the problem works as part of an interest in history or logic, and also for those who just want to play it for its own sake as a diversion. It's primarily designed for mobile browser but is also playable on desktop.

## Features

### Start screen

Before the game begins, there's a start screen that helps orient the user. It provides an introduction to the riddle, and buttons allow the user to look at an instruction screen or go directly to the game. The font was chosen for its medieval look, and the background colour was chosen to be suggestive of an old book or parchment.

### Instructions

The instructions are presented on a screen of their own to avoid overloading the user.

### Main Puzzle Screen

The main puzzle screen is a representation of two river banks (in green) and a river (in blue), with "tiles" representing a wolf, goat, and cabbages, and a boat. The animals and vegatables start on one side of the river and the goal is to get them to the other side, with the constraint that the wolf and goat can't be left together, and the cabbages and goat can't be left together. The tiles are clickable, which moves them to different locations.

The below screenshots show different configurations of the tiles:

### Invalid moves

If the boat attempts to move away from a bank while one of the forbidden pairs is on the bank, feedback is given to the user in the following ways:
* a popup message
* the boat's border turns red
* the boat's border shakes

### Win screen

When all the tiles are on the bottom bank, feedback is provided by having the tiles expand and contract, and then after a couple of seconds a win screen is displayed. The win screen has buttons to allow the user to restart.

## Unfixed Bugs

If the game is played through and then replayed, the animation for the tiles when the game is won doesn't work for two of the tiles. This doesn't affect the user's ability to play the game, but this is still a priority to fix in the future.
